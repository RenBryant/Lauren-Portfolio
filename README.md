User Story

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

In this project, a portfolio about the creator was to be created using HTML, CSS, and advanced CSS technologies.

This project was supposed to be informative, visually appealing, and easily accessible.

First I created a HTML skeleton that I thought would pair well with the idea that I had for the project. Then I worked on the css page.

I made sure that my website would have a navbar that moves as the user scrolls. I also decided to make my name in the header a link to my github page.

I added a placeholder profile picture that is in the header.

My portfolio has a working navbar, titled images of my current projects that are also links to the deployed website, and is adaptable for changes in the screen size.

A few extra things that I added to my project is a hover effect on all of the links. The words that are links change colors, and the pictures have an overlay effect that show that it is a link.

I also have a contacts div with a hyperlink to my linkedin profile.

Then in the footer I added 'Made by RenBryant' which is my github username and also a working back to the top link.
